After moving the .bash_profile to Users/<User>, you can use pugnew to update all of your config
files from this directory.

Make sure the <User>/Sites/Projects contains necessary directories from your httpd-vhosts.conf file,
and lookup the addresses for them in the hosts file.

Run
  /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'yourpasswordhere'
to update the mySQL password

Run
  mkdir ~/Sites/phpmyadmin/config
  chmod o+w ~/Sites/phpmyadmin/config
  
then visit http://localhost/~username/phpmyadmin/setup/ and add a new server, set the local mySQL
user and password, move config.inc.php from phpmyadmin/config to root level of phpmyadmin, then
remove the empty /config directory.

Happy hacking!
